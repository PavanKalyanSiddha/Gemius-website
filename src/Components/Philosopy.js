    <h1>“THOSE WHO TELL THE STORIES, <br />
   RULE THE WORLD.” - PLATO</h1><br />
   <p>The conquest of mankind on Earth has always revolved around story <br /> telling. Great kings and warriors alike, have fought and conquered <br /> to leave a legacy which stands the test of time. As the ages passed, <br /> the human story telling potential became more diverse and <br /> outreaching.</p><br />
   <p>Inspired by Plato and the stars, we at <b>Gemius</b> believe in the true <br />  power of words and art, and work to tell the marvellous stories of <br /> Industry Mavericks. We leave no stone unturned in finding the right <br /> balance between setting an ethos and creating a visual design, and <br /> work round the clock to make sure our customers are thriving.</p><br />
